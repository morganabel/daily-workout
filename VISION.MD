# 🏋️‍♂️ Workout Agent — Vision

## Why We Exist

**Workout Agent** is a minimalist, open-source workout companion that feels like a personal trainer with memory.
Tap a few bubbles, get a workout that fits your time, equipment, and recent training — no friction, no homework.

---

## Our Promise

- **Zero-friction personalization.** One or two taps → a workout that already knows your context.
- **Private-by-default.** Local-first, with optional encrypted sync.
- **Open, but elegant.** Apple-level simplicity, open-source transparency.

---

## What Makes Us Different

- **Batteries-included simplicity.** The default is fast, tactile, and obvious. No dense forms, no tedious logging.
- **Learns everything.** Over time it adapts to your split, preferences, recovery, and environment — without demanding effort.
- **Multiple ways to log (or not):**

  - Tap _Done_
  - Quick-edit checked sets
  - Speak/type free text — we parse it
  - Forget to “start”? One tap to log you did the thing

- **Cost-aware AI.** BYO API key works anywhere. On hosted, free tier gets a generous allowance, with graceful fallbacks (lighter models, “copy-paste prompt” mode for ChatGPT).

## Design Values

- **Radical simplicity.** Tactile, large targets, minimal text. The default path is one screen.
- **Calm, friendly, credible.** Feels like a trainer-friend: supportive, concise, never cheesy.
- **Context-aware, customizable.** Reactive today; proactive daily suggestions as you opt in.

---

## Open Source, The Quiet Way

- **Community Edition (AGPL):** fully functional, self-hostable, no artificial limits.
- **Managed Hosted:** same open core, usage-metered AI, optional premium upgrades.
- **Contribution for everyone.** In-app feedback and “vibe coding” hooks so non-technical users can shape features.

---

## Freemium That Respects Users

- **Free:** core generation + basic history, generous AI allowance on lighter models, BYOK always.
- **Paid:** higher-tier models, faster queues, optional plugins/analytics — actual value, not artificial restrictions.

---

## What We Won’t Do

- Dark patterns, ad clutter, or social pressure.
- Lock useful features behind paywalls when they belong in the core.
- Complicate the UI to serve edge cases.

---

## The Future We’re Building

A family of elegant, open consumer apps that people can use, study, and improve — proving that open-source can feel premium, personal, and profitable.
